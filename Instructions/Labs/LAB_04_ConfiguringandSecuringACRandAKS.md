# Lab 04: Configuring and Securing ACR and AKS

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to deploy a proof of concept with Azure Container Registry and Azure Kubernetes Service. In this lab scenario, you are tasked with deploying a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates the integration of Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The PoC will involve building a Docker image using a Dockerfile, pushing the image to ACR for storage, and configuring AKS to orchestrate containerized applications. Additionally, you will focus on securing the containerized applications and ensuring that they can be accessed both internally within the cluster and externally by end users.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Task 1: Create an Azure Container Registry
- Task 2: Create a Dockerfile, build a container and push it to Azure Container Registry
- Task 3: Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
- Task 4: Grant the AKS cluster permissions to access the ACR
- Task 5: Deploy an external service to AKS
- Task 6: Verify you can access an external AKS-hosted service
- Task 7: Deploy an internal service to AKS
- Task 8: Verify you can access an internal AKS-hosted service

## Estimated timing: 45 minutes
