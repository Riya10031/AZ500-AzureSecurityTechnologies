# Lab 01: Role-Based Access Control

## Lab scenario

You have been asked to create a proof of concept showing how Azure users and groups are created. Also, how role-based access control is used to assign roles to groups. Specifically, you need to:

- Create a Senior Admins group containing the user account of Joseph Price as its member.
- Create a Junior Admins group containing the user account of Isabel Garcia as its member.
- Create a Service Desk group containing the user account of Dylan Williams as its member.
- Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the Service Desk group.  

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercises

- Exercise 1: Create the Senior Admins group with the user account Joseph Price as its member (the Azure portal). 
- Exercise 2: Create the Junior Admins group with the user account Isabel Garcia as its member (PowerShell).
- Exercise 3: Create the Service Desk group with the user Dylan Williams as its member (Azure CLI). 
- Exercise 4: Assign the Virtual Machine Contributor role to the Service Desk group.
