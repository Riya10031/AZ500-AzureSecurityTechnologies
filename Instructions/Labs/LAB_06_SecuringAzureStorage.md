# Lab 06: Service Endpoints and Securing Storage

## Lab scenario

In this lab scenario, you are tasked with creating a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate securing Azure file shares. The PoC will involve setting up a storage endpoint to ensure that all traffic to Azure Storage remains within the Azure backbone network. Additionally, you will configure the storage endpoint to allow access only from resources within a specific subnet, while verifying that resources outside of this subnet are unable to access the storage, thereby ensuring enhanced security for the Azure file shares.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:

- Exercise 1: Service endpoints and security storage

## Architecture Diagram

![Architecture diagram](../images/arch-az-500-lab6.png)

## Exercise 1: Service endpoints and security storage

In this exercise, you will create a virtual network, add a subnet, and configure a storage endpoint. You will then set up network security groups to restrict subnet access and allow RDP on the public subnet, followed by creating a storage account with a file share and deploying virtual machines into subnets. Finally, you will test storage connections from the private subnet to confirm access is allowed, and from the public subnet to ensure access is denied.

### Task 1: Create a virtual network

In this task, you will create a virtual network.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Virtual networks (1)** and select **Virtual networks (2)** from the services.

   ![image](../images/az500lab12-1.png)

1. On the **Virtual Networks** blade, clickÂ **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create virtual network** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click on **IP Addresses (5)** tab.

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Subscription|**Leave the default subscription (1)**|
    |Resource group|click **Create new** and type the name **AZ500LAB06** then click **OK** **(2)**|
    |Name|**myVirtualNetwork (3)**|
    |Region|**(US) East US (4)**|

   ![image](../images/az500lab12-2.png)    

1. On the **IP addresses** tab of the **Create virtual network** blade, set the **IPv4 address space** to **10.0.0.0/16 (1)**. In the **Subnet name** column, click **default (2)** and, on the **Edit subnet** blade, specify the following settings, click **Save (5)** and then click on **Review+create (6)**.

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Subnet name|**Public (3)**|
    |Subnet address range|**10.0.0.0/24 (4)**|

   ![image](../images/az500lab12-3.png)

1. On the **Review + create** tab of the **Create virtual network** blade, click **Create**.

    >**Note**:If you are not able to edit the **default** first create the virtual network and go to subnets in created Virtual network and delete the Default Subnet and add **Public** Subnet 

1. Click on **Go to resources**.    

### Task 2: Add a subnet to the virtual network and configure a storage endpoint

In this task, you will create another subnet and enable a service endpoint on that subnet. Service endpoints are enabled per service, per subnet. 

1. On the **myVirtualNetwork** blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Subnets**.

1. On the **myVirtualNetwork \| Subnets (1)** blade, click **+ Subnet (2)**.

    |Service endpoints|**Leave the default of None**|

    ![image](../images/az500lab12-4.png)    

     >**Note**: The virtual network now has two subnets: Public and Private. 
	
### Task 3: Configure a network security group to restrict access to the subnet

In this task, you will create a network security group with two outbound security rules (Storage and internet) and one inbound security rule (RDP). You will also associate the network security group with the Private subnet. This will restrict outbound traffic from Azure VMs connected to that subnet.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Network security groups (1)** and select **Network security groups (2)** from the services.

	![image](../images/az500lab12-9.png)

	![image](../images/az500lab12-10.png)    

     >**Note**: This rule overrides a default rule in all network security groups that allows outbound internet communication. 

     >**Note**: In the next steps, you will create an inbound security rule that allows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) traffic to the subnet. The rule overrides a default security rule that denies all inbound traffic from the internet. Remote Desktop connections are allowed to the subnet so that connectivity can be tested in a later step.

1. Then **Paste and run the PowerShell script that you recorded earlier in this lab** and the click on **Run**. The script has the following format:

    ```powershell
    $connectTestResult = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net -Port 445
    if ($connectTestResult.TcpTestSucceeded) {
       # Save the password so the drive will persist on reboot
       cmd.exe /C "cmdkey /add:`"<storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net`" /user:`"localhost\<storage_account_name>`"  /pass:`"<storage_account_key>`""
       # Mount the drive

    }
    ```
    >**Note**: Dont copy this one, please paste the one that you had copied in the previous step.

    >**Note**: The `<storage_account_name>` placeholder represents the name of the storage account hosting the file share and `<storage_account_key>` one its primary key

    ![image](../images/az500lab12-43.png)     

1. Start File Explorer and verify that the Z: drive mapping has been successfully created.

    ![image](../images/az500lab12-44.png)   

1. Next, from the console pane of the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to verify that the virtual machine has no outbound connectivity to the internet:

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName www.bing.com -Port 80
    ```

    ![image](../images/az500lab12-45.png)       

    >**Note**: The test will fail because the network security group associated with the Private subnet does not allow outbound access to the internet.

1. Terminate the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPrivate** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: At this point, you have confirmed that the virtual machine in the Private subnet can access the storage account.

1. Click on **Yes** to connect to the RDP.    

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **myVMPublic**, click **Start** and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

1. Within the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window, open the **Script** pane by clickin on **File->New** from the top left corner. Then **paste and run the same PowerShell script** that you ran within the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPrivate** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: This time, you will receive the **New-PSDrive : Access is denied** error.

     >**Note**: Access is denied because the *myVmPublic* virtual machine is deployed in the Public subnet. The Public subnet does not have a service endpoint enabled for the Azure Storage. The storage account only allows network access from the Private subnet.

1. Next, from the console pane of the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to verify that the virtual machine has outbound connectivity to the internet: 

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName www.bing.com -Port 80
    ```

    >**Note**: The test will succeed because there is no network security group associated with the Public subnet.

1. Terminate the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPublic** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: At this point, you have confirmed that the virtual machine in the Public subnet cannot access the storage account, but has access to the internet.
