# Lab 02: Network Security Groups and Application Security Groups

## Lab scenario
You have been asked to implement your organization's virtual networking infrastructure and test to ensure it is working correctly. In particular:

- The organization has two groups of servers: Web Servers and Management Servers.
- Each group of servers should be in its own Application Security Group. 
- You should be able to RDP into the Management Servers, but not the Web Servers.
- The Web Servers should display the IIS web page when accessed from the internet. 
- Network security group rules should be used to control network access.  

 > For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following exercises:
- Exercise 1: Create the Virtual networking infrastructure
- Exercise 2: Deploy Virtual machines and test the network filters

In this task, you will test the network traffic filters. You should be able to RDP into the myVMMgmnt virtual machine. You should be able to connect from the internet to the myVmWeb virtual machine and view the default IIS web page.  

1. Navigate back to the **myVMMgmt** virtual machine blade.

1. On the **myVMMgmt** blade, click **Connect (1)** drop down and select **Connect (2)** from the drop down list. 

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-35.png)  

1. Click **RDP** then **Download RDP File**.

   ![image](../images/lab1-17.png)

1. Click on **Keep**, for the pop up that appears.   

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-36.png)  

1. Click on **Open file** from the top right corner.

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-37.png)

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-38.png)  

1. On the **Windows Security** pop up, click on **More choices.**

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-39.png)  

1. Select **Use a different account.**

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-40.png)  

1. Open that file and use it to connect to the **myVMMgmt** Azure VM via Remote Desktop. When prompted to authenticate, provide the following credentials, after providing the credentials, click on **OK (3)**:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |User name|**Student (1)**|
   |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234 (2)**|

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-41.png)     

    >**Note**: Verify that the Remote Desktop connection was successful. At this point you have confirmed you can connect via Remote Desktop to myVMMgmt.

1. Click on **Yes** to connect RDP.

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-42.png)  

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **myVmWeb** virtual machine blade.

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-43.png)  

1. On the **Run Command Script** pane, run the following to install the Web server role on **myVmWeb**:

    ```powershell
    Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
    ```

     ![image](../images/lab01-2.png)

    >**Note**: Wait for the installation to complete. This might take a couple of minutes. At that point, you can verify that myVmWeb can be accessed via HTTP/HTTPS.

1. After getting the output, close the **Run Command Script** blade, and navigate back to the **Overview (1)** page of **myVmWeb** blade. Copy and paste the **Public IP address (2)** of the myVmWeb Azure VM to the notepad.

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-45.png)  

1. Open another browser tab and navigate to IP address you identified in the previous step.

   ![image](../images/lab1-1.png)

    >**Note**: The browser page should display the default IIS welcome page because port 80 is allowed inbound from the internet based on the setting of the **myAsgWebServers** application security group. The network interface of the myVmWeb Azure VM is associated with that application security group. 

> **Result:** You have validated that the NSG and ASG configuration is working and traffic is being correctly managed.

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
   - If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
   - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
   - If you need any assistance, please contact us at labs-support@spektrasystems.com. We are available 24/7 to help you out.
